# rpv-clock

This is my customized clock / billboard / weather JS/HTML app.

It is intended as a Raspberry Pi related project but has no specific dependencies; 
it can run in any browser.

This is also a Vue.js learning exercise for me.

## Features

None currently.

## Build / Development

The following is from the vue-cli template.
